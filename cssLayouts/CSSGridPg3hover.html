			<h2>#01-Spiky-Hair</h2>
			<p>The first one i created under the Kester Team Brand. Spiky-Hair is a guy who uses his wits to outsmart even the troublesome of enemies whether it be cartoon hijinx or such. Originally when i made him. I colored him Blue with black hair since i based him off Sonic Team's Logo (No relation) But as i grew up and building up Kester Team I've decided to color code with with Triad colors and updated his hair multiple times to the final product you see today! His Orginal design can be seen on the Kento Takashi Logo.</p>

			<h2>#02-Hibari Gokumaru</h2>
			<p>Supposedly Kester Team's First Weekly Shonen All-Stars Manga Character Before Kento Takashi (AKA the Dragon Ball/Jojo of Kester Team) and the protagonist of the first part of the Excellent Saga series. Residing in Spirit Village, Hibari Gokumaru is a dude who is the manifestation of the 3 Cs. Calm, Cool and Collected. Rather than Go in Guns blazing, Hibari analyzes the situation and uses Offensive and Defensive techniques to subdue his foes via Chi and basic martial arts. His Chi Nature unlike others in the world of Excellent Saga is a rare one known as Baku meaning Spirit. Because of this, he's known to be one of few known as Excellent Chi Masters. His Signature Baku Dragon's Roaring Palm is a force to be reckoned with along with his Ultimate Baku Dragon Mode Created in 2009, I was watching Sub and Dub versions of DBZ Kai as a teen (as well as re-reading Dragon Ball Starting from the Z Saga) which helped inspired the elements of Hibari's Excellent Adventure as well as the main character Hibari Himself. Originally his name was gonna be Hibari Yamada. But the last name like Yamada means bad luck which really doesn't portray Hibari in a good light. So, I named him something heroic much like Son Goku and Jonathan Joestar, this led to the final name being Hibari Gokumaru.</p>

			<h2>#03-Kento Takashi</h2>
			<p>Originally the first Kester Team Anime/Weekly Shonen All-Stars Character but that slot is taken by Hibari. Meet Easygoing,Laid Back Kento Takashi. In the fictitious Nagreboshi City, Kento Takashi lives with his Uncle Norm and his Cousins, Spiker, Porygo and Shizuka and his pet TentaDragon, Koutou.  He's the wielder of an legendary weapon known as a Star Blade. This weapon is usually held by an intergalactic space force member known as the Milky Way Knights (Can't be Star Knights, Nintendo and HAL already call dibs with Kirby). Kento's Star Blade wasn't like the one you see. Originally it was the size of Ichigo's Zangetsu (Pre-Timeskip) which was heavy to weld but his Star Slash packs a wallop. Overtime, He found another Star Blade known as the Master Triple-Star which was lighter than his first one (both based of the fusion of Kirby's final weapons in Amazing Mirror and Squeak Squad), Which helped him on numerous occasions when his original star blade broke. His Signature Elemental Star Slash can Burn,Freeze or Electrocute enemies After a timeskip, Kento's Star Blade began to evolve as he merged two of his swords into a more powerful version known as the SuperStar Blade. it's aura is more powerful than a regular Milky Way Knight's Star Blade. It's Signature move Stardust Slash is a move not to be underestimated. After the final battle in the OG Kento series, Kento's SuperStar Blade evolved into a reformed and Super Powerful new Star Blade. This one as you see right now is the Galaxy SuperStar Blade seen in the Sequel,Kento Takashi: Plus & Minus. 
				<strong>Notes:</strong>
				Created in 2008, Kento was supposed to be not only the Mascot for Kester Team but also the 'First' Weekly Shonen All-Stars Character. But as you see i decided to scrap that and make Spiky-Hair, The mascot and Hibari Gokumaru the first Weekly Shonen All-Stars character. I did a couple of Animations of Kento and His Friends via Flipnote Studio (trust me you don't wanna see them). in Kento Takashi's logo you can see Spiky-Hair's basic design. Speaking of, the Logo has been giving a remodel. This Logo is was recreated in Illustrator and finalized in Photoshop and is the Logo you see today. This one is the new Plus & Minus Variant.</p>

			<h2>#04-KouTou Takashi</h2>
			<p>Design was based off a scrapped Kayefi X & Racoon Cat Kayefi Logo concept. What main character doesn't have a TentaDragon as a pet? Meet KouTou! Kento's Exotic Pet known as a TentaDragon. Some of these are currently in Hiding thanks to Devi Rocket The Bounty Hunter. TentaDragon's are much more rare than a regular dragon. All of them can swim and breathe any element with no consequence. (Example: A Fire Breathing TentaDragon who swims Underwater). Because of the power each of them contain, poachers will do anything to get their hands on them. Eating the meat of these creatures has said to have amazing powers, depending on who the person is. KouTou is a special TentaDragon who bred with a Red Raccoon-Cat, Not only KouTou is fast but he's extremely agile making his opponents confused and dazed. KouTou also supports his master, Kento when it comes to stopping invaders or school stuff. KouTou's Design was based of an idea i had as a kid. His design like Kento and Spiky-Hair was also based off Sonic Team's Logo as well as Shadow's logo. I also made stuff of KouTou with Kento Takashi as well.</p>
